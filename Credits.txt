KIRBY AND THE AMAZING MIRROR (JP) RANDOMIZER
============================================
Created and developed by Geoffrey "TG" McCullough.
I'd like to thank everyone who helped make this thing real:

Thank you to Teawater and Xira of Yoshi's Lighthouse for all
of the information about KatAM they've posted about. I
probably could not have started this project without their
shared knowledge.

Lots of help from A12Helton, since I was able to trick him
into doing work for me by having him mess around with
different objects. He also helped with getting all the
information I needed for the mirror locations.

Thank you Snipr_SR for helping playtest the ROMs for bugs I
need to fix. Sorry for all the white screen crashes!

And lastly, thank *YOU* for downloading this randomizer! My
main goal for any of my free time projects is to make
someting people love and enjoy. <3
